title: We need a better community space
---

If we want to be the first among peers, we need more focus on growing community.

A strong community is one that is cohesive, hosts a distinct culture, and supports well-being.

Today, there’s nowhere on campus for that to happen. We don’t have enough shared time or experiences to be cohesive, for culture to develop, or to know each other well enough to be supportive.

When we graduate, there’s little that links us back to current students. There’s no continuity in our community.

Our study and community spaces are outdated and uninspiring. We have an opportunity to remediate this in our new building.

We need a better space that I'm going to call The Blueprint. A student-owned sanctuary for collaboration and community.

This will be our space, where we belong, now as students, and future as alumni.

Students own The Blueprint. It will be programmed, decorated, and evolved by students. Students, in conjunction with alumni, have physical and metaphorical space to develop a cohesive, supportive, and distinct community.

For alumni, the Blueprint isn’t just a convenient, affordable coworking space, it’s a way to be involved in and give back to a relatable community from their alma mater. More alumni engagement means better career opportunities for everyone and improved funding for university programmes.

In the future, we’ll see new traditions emerge in the Blueprint from the sustained community. The Blueprint will be the beating heart of Columbia Engineering, tying students and alumni together.
